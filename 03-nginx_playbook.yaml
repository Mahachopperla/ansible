# in inventory we have multiple servers few may have redhat servers and few ubuntu
# in redhat package installation we use dnf
# and in ubuntu package installation we use apt
# if we use specific package codes then onstallation may fail for other family servers
# so in ansible we have package module which automatically findout which server it is going to install package
# and based on that server it installs package on that 
# if we run palybook through redhat servers it takes dnf and if we run through ubuntu it takes apt
# this is how ansible works
# ************* it indicates ansible is not homogeneous it's heterogeneous it works on all servers ********
