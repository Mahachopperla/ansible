we have multiple ways to declare vars

Let's understand which is given more prefernce when we declare same variables in all possible ways

1. define same variable in all possible locations
2. run the playbook

once we get to understand which is first preference comment that declaration

3. comment when you understand the preference

and run paybook again, so u will get to know which is given with decond preference.

follow the same until u get to know all preferences


************** PREFERENCES *********************

1.  args or command line
2.  within Task
3.  File
4.  Prompt
5.  Play level
6.  inventory

it is not mandatory to hardly remember these preferences

just understand 2 things:
-> first prefernce will be given to command line args
-> and when variables are declared globally , we can declare them again in task as inheritance and in such situation task is given with priority
